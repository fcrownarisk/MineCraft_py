This script creates a basic Minecraft-like game with the following features:

1. A 3D world with simple block types (grass, sand, brick, stone)
2. Player movement (WASD keys) and jumping (Spacebar)
3. Flying mode (Toggle with Tab key)
4. Block placement (Right-click) and removal (Left-click)
5. Simple collision detection
6. Basic world generation

To run this game, you'll need to install the Pyglet library:
```plaintext
 pip install pyglet
```
You'll also need to create a simple texture file named `texture.png`
in the same directory as the script. This file should be a 4x4 grid of 16x16 pixel textures for the different block types.

Here's a brief explanation of the main components:
1. `Model` class: Handles the game world, including block management and rendering.
2. `Window` class: Manages the game window, user input, and game loop.
3. `setup_fog` and `setup` functions: Configure the OpenGL environment.
4. `main` function: Initializes the game and starts the Pyglet event loop.

To play the game:

- Use WASD keys to move
- Use the mouse to look around
- Left-click to remove blocks
- Right-click to place blocks
- Press Spacebar to jump
- Press Tab to toggle flying mode
- Press Esc to release the mouse cursor

This implementation is a simplified version of Minecraft and doesn't include features like inventory, crafting, or complex world generation. However, it provides a solid foundation for further development and experimentation with 3D game programming in Python.
